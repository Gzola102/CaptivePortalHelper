#Captive Portal Checker
This is supposed to login transparently in the background.
It requires the URL's for Google Authentication to be unblocked.
It requires a webpage that:
* is blocked by Untangle rack that the chromebook uses by default
* is not blocked once the user is authenticated by Untangle
* the only content is "Success!", no HTML
